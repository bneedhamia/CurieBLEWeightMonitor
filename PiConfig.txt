Configuration of my Raspberry Pi 3
Out of the box
Brad Needham
Begun May 22, 2016

Installed Noobs on a 16GB MiniSD card.
Connected the Pi to an HDMI monitor, keyboard, and mouse.
Booted.
Selected Raspbian.
Clicked WiFi, chose the hotspot to connect to and its password.
Clicked Install.
Once it rebooted, it came up as a graphical interface, logged in as pi.

Tried to add a user, but not completely successfully:
sudo adduser pip
sudo adduser pip sudo
sudo vi /etc/hostname /etc/hostname
Changed hostname in those files from raspberrypi to doggate.
Shutdown from the Gui didn't work.
sudo shutdown -r now
groups          (noted what groups the user pi is in)
did a sudo adduser pip X for all X in those groups the user pi is in.
Problem: for some reason, if I login as my user pip, I can't logout via Gui.

Setup Raspberry Preferences:
menu / preferences / Raspberry Pi Configuration...
Selected the Localization tab
 Locale: USA English
 Timezone: US Pacific
 Keyboard: US English
 WiFi: US (probably should have done that before setting up Wifi)

Quickly updated the time: sudo ntpd -qg
Cloned github.com/bneedhamia/CurieBLEWeightMonitor so I can code on the Pi.
