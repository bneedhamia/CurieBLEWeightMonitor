# CurieBLEWeightMonitor
Arduino 101 (Curie) Sketch to continuously report my dog's weight using load sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
## Current Status
The first version of the scale is too sensitive to Pippa's position on the scale.  Redesigning the scale to use 4 Load Cell Amplifier boards. See ProjectDiary.odt for the progress on the project.
