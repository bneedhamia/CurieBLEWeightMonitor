# CurieBLEWeightMonitor
Arduino 101 (Curie) Sketch to continuously report my dog's weight using load sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
## Current Status
The redesigned circuit is running. I'm editing the 3D printed hold-downs for the Load Sensors, then need to write the Sketch that calculates weight and center of gravity. See ProjectDiary.odt for the progress on the project.
## Files
- ProjectDiary.odt = day-to-day diary of the progress of the project. Useful to see how the project unfolded over time.
- WeightScale.fzz = Fritzing circuit
- BillOfMaterials.ods = parts list, with suppliers and prices.
- MechanicalNotes.odp = diagrams of any complicated physical parts.
- ProjectMath.odp = mathematical background to the formulas in the code.
- Calculations.ods = Spreadsheet of testing and design measurements.
- loadsensorholder.FCStd = FreeCAD file for 3D printing hold-downs for the Load Sensors.
