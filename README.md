# CurieBLEWeightMonitor
Arduino 101 (Curie) Sketch to continuously report my dog's weight using load sensors and Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE).
## Current Status
The first version of the scale is too sensitive to Pippa's position on the scale.  Redesigning the scale to use 4 Load Cell Amplifier boards instead of 1. See ProjectDiary.odt for the progress on the project.
## Files
- ProjectDiary.odt = day-to-day diary of the progress of the project. Useful to see how the project unfolded over time.
- WeightScale.fzz = Fritzing circuit
- BillOfMaterials.ods = parts list, with suppliers and prices.
- MechanicalNotes.odp = diagrams of any complicated physical parts.
- ProjectMath.odp = mathematical background to the formulas in the code.
